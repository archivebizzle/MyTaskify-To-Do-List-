MyTaskify (To Do List) using HTML,CSS,PhP,JavaScript and AngularJS

INTRODUCTION

1.	It's sometimes hard to know which of the many items inyour Task Manager you should do now. This could be because you have other events coming up you need to attend, and there isn't time to do the most important things. Instead, you might find yourself wasting time or doing an unimportant smaller task, when there is something more important you could have completed if you knew about it.

2.	Certain tasks require more concentration and effort than others. If at any given time you do not feel up to completing a task that requires significant focus, you should do the most important thing that requires the least effort. This type of prioritizing isn't often managed by task manager applications or calendars, and that's one of the major changes we hoped to have in ours.

3.	Our goal was to create a user friendly and easy to use My Task Manager that rearranges itself around a calendar based on the due date and difficulty of each task. In addition, we wanted to familiarize ourselves with Angular Js, to rethink the role of the calendar and how mobile devices represent calendars, and to implement a basic auto-scheduling tool. There are existing task manager applications and calendar applications, but nothing that attempts to integrate the two in a useful manner. We decided that the best way to achieve our goals in the context of Software Engineering was to create a Web Application.

People are very busy these days and it’s really very hard to keep everything in mind, they must need a web application where they can keep notes about the important tasks they have to do because everyone can’t hire a personal assistant to make them remind for everything.
